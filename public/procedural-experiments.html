          <h2><em>Road Systems</em> 2018 - ongoing</h2>
          <p>Recently I began working on a procedural toolkit for future works. I am particularly interested in generative cities, so creating road systems seemed like a good place to start. My hope is that this toolset will be useful in future works of my own, and also flexible enough to be useful to others.</p>
          <p>My primary reference for this system has been <a href="https://graphics.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2001/p_Par01.pdf">a paper by Parish and MÃ¼ller</a> (which was also utilized in a great write-up <a href="https://www.tmwhere.com/city_generation.html">here</a>)</p>
          <p>Work in this project began in OpenFrameworks, but after some point it became clear to me that it was possibly less useful to me on that platform, and I began to port my work over to THREE.js, where I've continued. The system itself can be represented by an undirected graph. It consists of a series of nodes that contain references to all roads it is connected to, which is necessary for traversal as well as building lot generation.</p>
          <p><strong>Currently</strong> the project is ongoing, with my focus currently on generating buildings and terrain.</p>

          <h2>Growth Patterns</h2>
          <p>As the first of my procedural experiments, this project began with handdrawn plants and branches. I was interested in how someone might intuitively draw a branch or plant, and this was my attempt to build a digital system based on those rules.</p>
          <p>The system begins by generating a single, multisegmented branch. Each segment should tend towards some imagined light source, and be skewed by the direction of the segment that came before it.</p>
          <p>Once this is finished, the process is repeated on random segments, allowing new, shorter branches to emerge.</p>
          <p>I intend to continue on this and make it compatible with the procedural city generation tools I am working on.</p>
