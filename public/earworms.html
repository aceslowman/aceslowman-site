                <b><i>a week of earworms</i></b>
              </span> looks at the melodies that I had stuck in my head from October 18th, 2020 to October 24th 2020. I recorded the name of the first melody that came to mind, three times a day, and if they repeated I counted it as an earworm. At the end of the week I transcribed the melodies.\n\n With this project I was interested in understanding more about the role of earworms in my experience with OCD. \n\nThis project involves audio, using Tone.js and p5.Sound, used to play sound files synced to a MIDI file. The earworm data was collected by hand and my listening history was collected using LastFM. \n\nAudio works best in Chrome.
