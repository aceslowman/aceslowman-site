# THREEjs Node Boilerplate

Modular THREEjs boilerplate based on a technique defined [here](https://medium.com/@soffritti.pierfrancesco/how-to-organize-the-structure-of-a-three-js-project-77649f58fa3f).

## How To Use
```
npm install
npm run dev
// or `npm run build` if production
npm run start
```

The example will be available at `localhost:3000`

## TODO 

I hope to reduce the bundle size with gzip, at this moment it's around 550KiB.
The eventbus seems to work well, but I will likely tweak it as I begin using this boilerplate more often.
